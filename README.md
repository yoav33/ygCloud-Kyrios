# ygCloud Kyrios
 
My personal iCloud rip-off. 'Kyrios' is the code that manages the actual cloud/drive storage and data handling.

## Security features:
- Passkeys are verified purely on the server side, so clients absolutely cannot connect without the correct passkey.
- 3rd-party client apps are quite easy to create using the client template.

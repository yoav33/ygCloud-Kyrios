# ygCloud Kyrios
 
My personal iCloud rip-off. 'Kyrios' is the code that manages the actual cloud/drive storage and data handling.

## Current compatibility:
- RainDrop (listener, sender. Not fully functional on Mac yet)
- StratusSend (WIP)

## Features:
- Passkeys are verified purely on the server side, so clients absolutely cannot connect without the correct passkey.
- Passkeys can be as long as you want
- A lot of bulk can be removed depending on which apps you'd like to use with ygCloud
- Standardized passkey verification method makes adding 3rd party client support easy
